              <p class="card-text project-text">The current educational system often relies on traditional methods of assessment, such as exams and essays. These methods can be stressful for students.. Essays can be difficult  to write, and they can provide limited feedback on the student's knowledge. Traditional methods of assessment can also be time-consuming for teachers . A student quiz portal can be a less stressful way for students to assess their knowledge. Quizzes can provide immediate feedback to students on their answers, and they can be used to track students' progress . Quizzes can also be tailored to the individual needs of students, so that they can focus on the areas where they need the most help. The student quiz portal project aims to create a platform for students to take quizzes and receive feedback on their learning.

              <p class="card-text project-text">The Music Player is a Java-based mini-project that offers a simple yet functional
                application for playing MP3 music files. Developed using the Swing framework,
                it provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) where users can select,
                control, and enjoy their favorite tunes with ease. The player's key features
                include a "Select Mp3" button for choosing songs from the local system, along
                with play, pause, resume, and stop buttons for smooth music playback. By
                leveraging threads for audio processing and the Java Zoom MP3 library for
                seamless playback, the Music Player provides an efficient and enjoyable music
                listening experience.
